# java-immutable-extension

This repository contains common items that extend the java immutable model repository.
Unlike the java immutable model project, these items align to specific patterns and are not easily reusable
for projects that do not align with the patterns.

For question about this repository, feel free to reach out to contact@powerupsoftwareengineering.com.
